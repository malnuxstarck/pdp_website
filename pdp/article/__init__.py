"""Module for handling user-written short articles.

This module is no longer used as an interactive one, but is just kept in order
to redirect old articles to their new linked tutorial so that SEO remains good
and in order to avoid dead links (like from social media and user favs).

This module may be entirely deleted in the future, when major search engines
will have updated their fields thanks to the permanent redirection.
