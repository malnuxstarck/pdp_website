# From Py2 to Py3

Here is a little document about migrating Progdupeupl to Python 3.

## Incompatible libraries

Here is a list of incompatible libraries, to wait to be Py3-ready or to remove
from projet dependencies :

 * Paramiko
 * django-oauth2-provider
 * django-simple-captcha
 * django-dynamic-fixture

And maybe others.

## TODO

This has to be implemented when all required libraries will be availaible under
Py3, which is not the case actually.

 * Replace `from cString import StringIO` by `from io import StringIO`.
