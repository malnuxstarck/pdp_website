# From Py2 to Py3

Here is a little document about migrating Progdupeupl to Python 3.

## Fixing incompatible libraries

Here is the list of incompatible libraries that we use.

We have to wait them to be ported to Python 3 (we can even create patches and
submit it to their authors for small libraries) or to remove some of them from
projet dependencies.

 * crispy-forms-foundation
 * django-filter
 * django-oauth2-provider
 * django-rest-swagger
 * fabric
 * django-simple-math-captcha

This list was generated using the `caniusepython3` program available on PyPI.
Feel free to update this list if necessary.

## Fix our own code

The following intructions have to be implemented in order to make our code
compatible with Python 3 when all the bad dependencies have been fixed.

 * Replace `from cString import StringIO` by `from io import StringIO`.
 * Use new (and way less verbose) syntax for `super()` call.

guidelines](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/python3/).
